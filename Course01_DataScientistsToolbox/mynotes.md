“Rubber duck debugging” is a long held tradition of solitary programmers everywhere. In the book “The Pragmatic Programmer,” there is a story of how stumped programmers would explain their problem to a rubber duck, and in the process of explaining the problem, identify the solution.

#### 4How to ask questions

- The question you are trying to answer

- How you approached the problem, what steps you have already taken to answer the question

- What steps will reproduce the problem (including sample data for troubleshooters to work from!)
-  What was the expected output
-  What you saw instead (including any error messages you received!)
- What troubleshooting steps you have already tried
- Details about your set-up, eg: what operating system you are using, what version of the product you have installed (eg: R, Rpackages)
- Be specific in the title of your questions!
